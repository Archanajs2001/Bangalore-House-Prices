#Power BI Project: Bangalore House Prices
#Overview
#Welcome to the Bangalore House Prices Power BI project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing housing prices in Bangalore based on a dataset containing details about housing units. The data covers various aspects such as size, location, total square footage, and prices. The visualizations and insights aim to provide a comprehensive view of the housing market in Bangalore.

#Data
#Source
The dataset used for this project, "Bangalore House Prices," was collected and cleaned using Python in Google Colab. The data includes information about housing units, such as size, location, total square footage, and prices.

#Data Cleaning
